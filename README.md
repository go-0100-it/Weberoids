# Weberoids
An online game based on the famous old school Asteroids

This game is intended to be hosted on my web site once complete, but if you'd like to try it out early on you can do so by doing the following;

1. Download the repo zip file.
2. Unzip the file.
3. Open the [index.html] file in your browser.  (I suugest you use Chrome or Firefox for best results, I have tested in Edge and it works but best played in Chrome).
